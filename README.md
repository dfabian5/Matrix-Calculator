# Matrix-Calculator
This project contains full classes for both Fractions and Matricies to use in the calculator.
The matrix class has optimizations such as multi threading for multiplication and uses
the fastest methods for calculating determinants and answers to linear equations.

## File Contents
  - "Calculator.h" contains all the calculator UI and linear equation solving functions
  - "Matrix.h" contains templated Matrix class and implementation
  - "Fraction" contains templated Fraction class and implementation
  - "main.cpp" contains main function...

## Calculator Can Work With:
  - Rational numbers
  - Real numbers
  - Complex numbers with rational coeficients
  - Complex numbers with real coeficients

## Calculator Can:
  - calculate answers to a system of linear equations
  - calculate a matrix's rank
  - calculate a matrix's determinant
  - calculate a matrix's inverse
  - calculate a matrix to a power
  - calculate a matrix's transpose
  - calculate a matrix's Row Echelon Form
  - multiply two matrices
