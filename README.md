# Matrix-Calculator
This project contains full classes for both Fractions and Matricies to use in the calculator.
The matrix class has optimizations such as multi threading for multiplication, a special Row
Echelon function for square matrices that heavily decreases the run time of finding inverses
and determinants.
All the calculator UI functions are located in "Calculator.h".

## Calculator Can Work With:
  - Rational numbers
  - Real numbers
  - Complex numbers with rational coeficients
  - Complex numbers with real coeficients

## Calculator Can:
  - calculate answers to a system of linear equations
  - calculate a matrix's rank
  - calculate a matrix's determinant
  - calculate a matrix's inverse
  - calculate a matrix to a power
  - calculate a matrix's transpose
  - calculate a matrix's Row Echelon Form
  - multiply two matrices
  - scalar multiplication
  - add/subtract two matrices
